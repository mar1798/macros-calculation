# Drewl frontend repository

## Packages

- `widgets`: UI component library.

## Apps 

- `website`: an application that uses nextjs, and the widgets package to render the website. 


## Commands

To check the project

```bash
npm run check
```


### ENV Variables:

```bash
...
```

## Package `widgets`

Currently, includes React components (organized by folder following the recommendations of [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)).

Commonly used styles and themes are also located here.

Hooks and contexts are also located here.

Creating a new component looks like this:

```bash
npm run generate -w widgets
```

Widget development and testing takes place through [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

```bash
npm run storybook -w widgets
```

## Widgets package:

A library of components grouped according to the [atomic design principle](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/). Everything is quite standard except for styling, which uses the [vanilla-extract-css library](https://vanilla-extract.style/).

### Vanilla-extract-css:

In essence, vanilla-extract-css can be considered as "CSS modules with TypeScript." All css.ts files are compiled into CSS during the project build, so this should be taken into account. The library does not have a runtime. All shared styles, as well as utilities for writing styles, are located in the /src/styling folder.

### Folder descriptions:

`/src/contexts` - React contexts

`/src/hooks` - Custom React hooks

`/src/svg` - Icons

`/src/types` - Definitions of shared types (those that are likely to be reused in external packages, preferably include only JSON-serializable types here)

`/src/util` - Set of common utilities that couldn't be categorized into other specific directories

`/src/testing` - Utilities for testing and Storybook

`/tools` - Set of scripts for console utilities (currently used for generating component boilerplates, more on that later)

Many of these folders contain automatically generated index.ts files (they are generated after generating atoms/molecules/organisms, and they can also be generated manually using npm run barrels). The generation settings are stored in [.barrels.json files](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barrelsby). This also applies to the front-website package.

### Generating component boilerplates:

To create a template for an `atom/molecule/organism`, run:

```bash
npm run generate -w widgets
```

Then choose the desired component type and specify its name.

This will create a folder with the component, including the component file, Storybook, boilerplate files for styles and tests.

After that, you can start the Storybook with `npm run storybook -w widgets` and begin developing the component.

## Website app:

...


## General:

It is important to separate the API interaction logic from the visual component library. Also, specific things unrelated to the website's appearance (such as analytics) should be separated. This is why the code is divided into front-website and widgets.

Before pushing changes, run:

`npm run check` - This checks types and lints the entire project.
